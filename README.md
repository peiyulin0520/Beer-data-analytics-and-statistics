# Beer-data-analytics-and-statistics
In this project, the beer company want to design a new product, so the beer data is cleaned, observed, and analysed through the statistics test. 

The tests mainly focus on rating scores, types of beers, ABV, Sweet and Malty flavours. 
At the end of the project (in the section 2), the statistical results and business insights are presented.
